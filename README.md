# favorite_SAS_macros

This (unfortunately poorly updated) repository contains some random personal SAS macros. 

**Column_Names** selects all of the column names from a dataset into a list

**Formatting** just sets a format for 0->0.1, 0.1-> 0.2, etc. and 0 -> 0.05, 0.05 -> 0.1, etc. 

**Testing_Variables_In_Logistic** takes a variable list (needs to be identified in advance), feeds it into a stepwise logistic regression, then runs the logistic regression to generate results. The results are then plotted on a gains chart.
